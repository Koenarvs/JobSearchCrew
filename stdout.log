Use the SerperDevTool to conduct a comprehensive search for new job postings, specifically focusing on positions that are not part of the candidate's current or previous job titles as listed in their resume. Utilize the recommended job titles and work locations provided in the resume analysis as key filters for your search.

It's crucial to ensure each search result reflects a specific, individual job opportunity—not a general listing that aggregates multiple jobs. If the search results include links to job boards or pages listing multiple job opportunities, refine your search criteria to target unique job postings. Each listing should be for a distinct position with a clear job title and detailed description available.

Continue refining your search by using insights gained from previous results if the initial search yields fewer than 10 suitable postings. Your goal is to gather at least 10 specific job postings that closely match the candidate's desired job titles and locations, each with a detailed description and a direct application link.
