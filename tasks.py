            2. Candidate's key skills
            3. Relevant experience
            4. Notable qualifications
            5. Preferred work location (if explicitly stated in the resume)
                - If a specific location is mentioned, include both the location and "Remote/Work from Home" as options
                - If no location is specified, include only "Remote/Work from Home" as an option
                - If the resume explicitly states the candidate is not interested in remote work, include only the specified location
            6. Recommended job titles (5-10) that best match the candidate's qualifications
                - Start by considering the candidate's current and previous job titles as a baseline
                - Build upon these job titles based on the candidate's key skills, relevant experience, and domain expertise
                - Focus on job titles that directly relate to the candidate's background and highlight their growth and progression
                - Consider the candidate's seniority level and include appropriate job titles (e.g., Senior, Lead, Manager, Director)
                - Avoid generic or unrelated job titles that do not align with the candidate's experience
            7. Any other important information that could help match the candidate to suitable job opportunities

Utilize the recommended job titles and work locations provided in the resume analysis as key filters for your search.

            It's crucial to ensure each search result reflects a specific, individual job opportunityâ€”not a general listing that aggregates multiple jobs. If the search results include links to job boards or pages listing multiple job opportunities, refine your search criteria to target unique job postings. Each listing should be for a distinct position with a clear job title and detailed description available.

            Continue refining your search by using insights gained from previous results if the initial search yields fewer than 10 suitable postings. Your goal is to gather at least 10 specific job postings that closely match the candidate's desired job titles and locations, each with a detailed description and a direct application link.
