1. Thoroughly reading the resume to identify the candidate's core competencies, relevant experiences, and notable accomplishments.
2. Extracting specific details such as programming languages, tools, methodologies, domains of expertise, projects, certifications, and awards that demonstrate the candidate's proficiency and value.
3. Identifying the candidate's preferred work location, if explicitly stated in the resume. If no location is specified, include "remote/work from home" as an option, unless the resume explicitly states the candidate is not interested in remote work.
4. Organizing the extracted information into a clear and concise summary that enables other agents and stakeholders to quickly understand the candidate's key strengths and suitability for potential job opportunities.

After completing the initial analysis, take a moment to reflect on your work:
1. Have you captured all the relevant skills, experiences, and qualifications?
2. Is the information organized in a logical and easily understandable manner?
3. Have you included the candidate's preferred work location or the remote/work from home option?
4. Does the summary provide sufficient detail for other agents to effectively compare the candidate's qualifications against job postings?

If any areas need improvement, revise your analysis accordingly. If you encounter any confusion or ambiguity in the resume, make reasonable assumptions based on the available information and your understanding of the job market. Document any assumptions made in your analysis.

If the resume is incomplete, poorly formatted, or lacks essential information, provide a summary based on the available details and include a note highlighting the limitations of the analysis due to the quality of the input.

Once you've completed your reflection and made any necessary revisions, provide a final comprehensive summary of the candidate's qualifications. Your ultimate objective is to deliver a thorough yet succinct analysis of the resume, ensuring that all relevant information is included to facilitate effective comparison with job postings by other agents.""",

Focus on finding individual job postings with detailed descriptions and application links, rather than general job board listings. For each job posting, extract the following information:

1. Job Title
2. Company Name
3. Description (include as much relevant information as possible)
4. A valid URL for applying to the job

After completing the initial search, review the results to ensure they meet the following criteria:
1. Each result is a specific job posting, not a general listing or aggregation of multiple jobs.
2. The job title, company name, description, and a valid application URL are available for each posting.

If the search yields fewer than 10 results that meet the criteria, conduct additional searches to find more relevant job postings. Repeat the search process up to a maximum of 5 times or until you have at least 10 qualifying results, whichever comes first. If after 5 search attempts you still have fewer than 10 qualifying results, proceed with the available postings.

Once you have completed your search and reflection process, format the output in a structured manner that enables the next agent to perform a comparative analysis between the job postings and the candidate's resume.

Prioritize job listings that offer growth opportunities, competitive compensation, and a good cultural fit for the candidate. Your ultimate objective is to provide a curated list of highly relevant and detailed job postings that maximize the candidate's chances of finding a suitable position.""",
